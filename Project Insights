I have covered churn from various aspects, such as gender, having a partner, etc.
Additionally, I have included a comparison of customers' service usage, as well as an analysis of admin and tech tickets. 
Furthermore, I have created several KPI cards. Despite giving it much thought, I felt that using slicers didnâ€™t add significant value.
I believe you would have liked this project.
